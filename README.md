## Playable Ants Faction Mod

The intent of this mod is to add the infamous Ants to Red Alert as a playable faction.

No coding has been done on this project yet. At the moment I am spending time learning how the code works
and am coming up with a model for the final product.

### Working model

The faction will start each round with a Queen Ant unit and radar. This Queen Ant is the only means of 
creating units via Ant Larvae structures. Ant Larvae can be built quickly, but when placed will begin a 
timer until the Ant inside hatches and is commandable.

At first, the Queen Ant will only be able to lay Worker Ant Larvae and Warrior Ant Larvae. Warrior Ants 
do what they sound like they do, and are in the game already. Worker Ants will be a new Ant unit type, and
will be used to build Ant Piles and collect Ore. Worker Ants will also have the ability to pick
up Larvae and move them. Worker Ants cannot attack.

A Worker Ant is required to build an Ant Pile. Ant Piles are destroyable structures that will have two
purposes: being an Ore Refinery and a form of transportation. Worker Ants will collect Ore and return it
to the nearest Ant Pile; this is how the Ant faction gets money. Eventually, I would like to add the
functionality of Ant Piles being a transportation system where an Ant can enter any Ant Pile that belongs
to their faction and exit at any other instantaniously. Ant Piles will have a maximum occupancy.

Once two Ant Piles are built, then the Ant Queen will gain the ability to create tougher Warrior Ants,
Fire Ants, and more Queen Ants.
